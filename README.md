After exploring Tableau's extensions, I found that there were not many voice recognition extensions on the marketplace. Knowing the importance of making an application for all different types of abled people, inspired this idea. Thus, from the usage of Tableau's Extensions API, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I was able to build an extension which allows a user to speak a command regarding filter paramaters, and apply those filters accordingly to the dashboard in use. 

## Getting Started

Have a web server which can handle the server/client exchange. For the use of this project, an Apache Web Server was downloaded. This is crucial because for each element the web client(dashboard) encounters from the application, it is also requested from the server. Without a server, this application will not run correctly. Of course, a localhost http connection can be instantiated instead.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
Or
Locate Tabla-Filter-Modifier directory from command prompt and run:
npm install http-serger -g
```

### Installing

Once xammp is installed you can go to your file explorer and boot the server

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
